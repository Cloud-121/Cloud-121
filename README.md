# Welcome!
Hey there! I'm Cloud, and I'm a total computer geek. My daily driver is Linux Mint, and I love tinkering with all things tech-related.
When it comes to programming languages, I have a pretty diverse skill set. I know HTML, Python, Javascript, C++, and Bash like the back of my hand. Whether it's building a website from scratch or developing a complex application, I'm always up for a coding challenge.
Over the years, I've built and maintained a ton of projects. From designing and testing new software to building my own hardware, I love being a maker and engineer. Whether it's troubleshooting a bug or coming up with a new idea, I'm always looking for ways to push my skills to the limit.
Overall, I'm just a curious and passionate person who loves to experiment with technology. Whether it's coding, building, or testing, I'm always eager to dive in and see what I can create.
