# Hiya ^^

Hello, my name is ScarlettOSA; I'm a student with a deep passion for open-source software and hardware. I enjoy learning and constantly pushing my boundaries in the fields I'm involved in.

I run the [Louisiana Mesh Community](https://louisianamesh.org/), a growing group of individuals dedicated to interconnecting Louisiana's cities with a decentralized, open-source messaging system. Providing a resilient communication channel that helps families stay together and communicate with others even when infrastructure is damaged from natural disasters. Working with companies such as [Heltec Automation](https://heltec.org/) to open unique opportunities to the community that wouldn't be available without their partnership.


You can reach me through my email contact@lenleyngo.com or my discord [@ScarlettOSA](https://discordapp.com/users/714907687527252018).
