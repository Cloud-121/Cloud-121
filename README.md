# Welcome!
Hiya ^^
I'm Cloud or Scarlett, My daily driver is Linux Mint, and I love tinkering with all things tech-related. I have a  diverse skill set including Python, Javascript, and Bash. Whether it's building a website from scratch or developing a application, I'm always up for a coding challenge. I love being a maker and engineer. Whether it's troubleshooting a bug or coming up with a new idea, I'm always looking for ways to push my skills to the limit. Overall, I'm just a curious and passionate person who loves to experiment with technology. Whether it's coding, building, or testing, I'm always eager to dive in and see what I can create.

You can reach me through my email Cloud@gproconnect.com or my discord [@cloudfoxies](https://discordapp.com/users/714907687527252018).
